This program organizes the HSC data from VC19. This dataset has 107 common reference stars that appear in all 11 files, along with their corresponding source stars. We graph both and make the reference star
constant such that the variability of the source can be analyzed. 

It is worth noting that this is all HSC-g data, meaning it is in the green band. 

# Files and their formatting
-----------------
## light_curves folder

This folder contains the light curves for all 107 reference stars and their corresponding source. Both are graphed with a legend, and the file names have the reference star's given ID from the HSC
dataset. The ID is also located on the title of the graph and they both match. 

## periods.txt

This file is formatted as such, and contains 107 rows. 

*reference_id* - *period in days*
