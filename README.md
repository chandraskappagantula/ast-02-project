This program organizes the HSC data for an RR Lyrae candidate in the NGVS region VC14. This code can be adapted to analyze phase-folded lightcurves for any periodic variable star, however. It uses the LombScargle implementation in the Gatspy module from Vanderplas et al. 

It is worth noting that this is all HSC-g data, meaning it is in the green band. Typically RR Lyrae have the highest SNR in the g-band.
